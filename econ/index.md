for Wordpress.

## About

Econ is a Wordpress plugin for creating advanced contact forms. There are lots
of contact form plugins for Wordpress but very few offer much customisation and
almost none offer as much as Econ.

Create multiple contact forms for your Wordpress site, with many different types
of input field and multiple pages in one form; all responses are saved
automatically on the user's computer whilst they are completing a contact form
in case they accidentally close the website.  Once a form is submitted, a copy
of that form can be optionally emailed to the user as well as to you.

Econ also includes a response processing system that allows the owner of the
website to manage and process responses right from within the Wordpress admin
console. Each response can be marked using one of several useful labels to
indicate if a query has yet been dealt with.

* Text (single and multi-line)
