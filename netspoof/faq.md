# Network Spoofer FAQ

## Network Spoofer doesn't work!

Firstly, make sure that you are connected to the correct wireless network, and
have chosen the correct settings in the app. Unfortunately I don't support
Network Spoofer any more but you might have some luck on
[Github](https://github.com/w-shackleton/android-netspoof/issues)

## Network Spoofer gets detected by my antivirus software

Network Spoofer is detected as a virus by some programs due to the way these
programs search for viruses – see the ‘Effectiveness‘ section of the wikipedia
page on Heuristic analysis.

Other problems are caused by antivirus software on your phone - this doesn't
mean it's malicious. Please note that Network Spoofer is not a virus, malware
or any sort of spyware – nothing is done to your phone, only to websites
visited. No data is collected from these websites.

## Network Spoofer stops working after some amount of time

Try leaving your phone screen on - some phones go to sleep when the screen is
off - this can stop Network Spoofer from working.
